##Description

G4 is an easy-to-use, comprehensive travel software that pairs travelers with ideal locations based on their interests. Whether you're looking for "beaches," "mountains," or "historical sites," 
G4 will show you where to go for food, entertainment, and more.

Users will  create account and be able to search and reserve activities according to their preferences on a dynamic platform. G4 provides a list of suggested destinations 
with comprehensive activity alternatives, ranging from exhilarating outdoor experiences to leisurely dining establishments. They will be able to add reviews for each card they added.

Activity Providers can create comprehensive listings for their food, and entertainment alternatives. Users can easily find and reserve what interests them by searching 
for similar activities or destinations and seeing these items pop up.

Customers can save their preferred alternatives as they browse through a well curated range of venues and activities. They can use the app to directly book 
and pay for an experience after they've found something they really enjoy.

SysAdmins can flag and remove any improper or obsolete material, as well as reviews and comments, and can monitor all content to ensure that listings are accurate.
